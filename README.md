Maltrieve
=========

Maltrieve originated as a fork of [mwcrawler](https://github.com/ricardo-dias/mwcrawler). It retrieves malware directly from the sources as listed at a number of sites, including:

* [Malware Domain List](http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/mdl.xml)
* [VX Vault](http://vxvault.siri-urz.net/URL_List.php)
* [Malc0de](http://malc0de.com/rss)
* [Sacour.cn](http://www.sacour.cn)

Other lists will be implemented when they return to activity.

* [Malware Black List](http://www.malwareblacklist.com/mbl.xml)
* [NovCon Minotaur](http://minotauranalysis.com/malwarelist-urls.aspx)


Other improvements include:

* Proxy support
* Multithreading for improved performance
* Logging of source URLs
* Multiple user agent support
* Better error handling
